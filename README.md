# 4-floor-elevator-system

This is an embedded systems course project. it simulates an elevator system which is based on three atmega2560 microcontrollers which control the following sections: 
1- The elevator itself.
2- The whole building and how each floor can call the elevator.
3- The administrator part of the system.
I have used UART protocol to communicate between the microcontrollers. I have written the device drivers for the atmeag2560 and interfaced switches, LEDs, 7-Segments, LCD, and a DC motor driver.
I have simulated the whole system using Proteus simulator.
